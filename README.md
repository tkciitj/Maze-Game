Developed a console-based maze game in C that generates dynamic mazes and challenges players to navigate from the start to the finish. The game features multiple maze layouts, player movement tracking, and an interactive scoring system based on the number of steps taken. The player navigates through the maze using simple controls (W, A, S, D), with real-time feedback on their progress.
